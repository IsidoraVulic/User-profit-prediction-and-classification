This was my final thesis data science project. 

EDA (Exploratory data analysis) is not published here because of an NDA, but the overall picture of the project can be seen in the provided code.
The idea was to compare the efficacy of traditional machine learning algorithms with the deep learning neural networks.

Neural networks produced the best results, with R2 of over 70%. XGBoost ensemble algorithm was the second best, with R2 of 69,91%.
